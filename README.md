# Raycasting Demo

This is a snapshot of a raycasting experiment I wrote in my spare
time, without following existing tutorials. The rudimentary and buggy
initial version was written during 2021--2023. I revisited it in 2026,
and started getting satisfactory results.

Build it and run it using:

```
make
./a.out
```

I'm developing (branch: `auto-rotate-demo`, commit:
